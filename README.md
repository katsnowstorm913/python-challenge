PyBank
  
    In PyBank the code takes a csv file of financial records and collects the amount of months in the data set, the total 
    of profits/losses over the whole data set, average change in profits/losses, finds the date/amount for the greatest 
    increase in profits, and the date/amount for the greatest decrease in losses. It then outputs the results to a seperate 
    analysis text file
    
PyPoll

    In PyPoll the code takes a csv file of election results and records the total amount of votes cast, and keeps track of 
    each candidate and the amount of votes they recieve. It uses that data to find the percent of the votes each candidate 
    recieves and the winner of the election, and outputs the stats for each candidate and the winner to a text file.
